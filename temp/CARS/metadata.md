| Field          | Unit | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| angle-1-2      | deg  | Angle between laser 1 and laser 2                            |
| angle-1-3      | deg  | Angle between laser 1 and laser 3                            |
| phase-matching | -    | Phase matching scheme, e.g. colinear, BoxCARS, folded BoxCARS, USED CARS; Note: Further information about the phase matching should be supplied in the dataset - e.g. as sketch - because of lacking standard way to do this for all phase matching geometries |
| branch         | -    | Probe species and branch                                     |
| detection      | -    | Detection system                                             |
