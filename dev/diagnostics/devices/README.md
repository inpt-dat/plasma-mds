* The generic metadata schema for measurement instruments should serve as general header for more specific metadata schemata of distinct device classes.

* Some keys map to the pidinst meta data schema “Metadata Schema for the Persistent Identification of Scientific Measuring Instruments” (https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00070), see also
https://github.com/rdawg-pidinst/schema/blob/master/schema.rst#

* Devices are called measuring instruments according to pidinst. (In contrast to processing instruments, e.g. reactors for thin film deposition)
