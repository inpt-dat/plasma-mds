            "properties": "The plasma was ignited in a quartz tube (4 mm ID and 6 mm OD, 100 mm length) surrounded by copper electrodes (10 mm width) separated by 20 mm. A PVM500 Plasma Resonant and Dielectric Barrier Corona Driver power supply (Information Unlimited) was used to sustain the plasma. The distance between the electrodes was 20 mm in all experiments. Voltage and frequency were kept constant throughout all experiments at 18.3 \u00b1 0.2 kV (peak-to-peak) and 24.9 kHz, respectively. The return current values were between ca. 4 and 7 mA. The experimental setup was positioned inside a large Faraday cage with the mesh size of 22 mm.",
            "procedure": "In a typical experiment, 100 \u00b5L of liquid sample was placed in a well on top of a glass stand inside the reactor. The distance from the nozzle to the sample was 10 mm unless stated otherwise. In experiments when the samples were at the 4 mm distance from the sample to the nozzle, the distance between the live electrode and the sample was maintained at 20 mm. Thus, the plasma length from the core plasma remained the same throughout all experiments, and the ratio of its quartz surroundings changed. The reactor was flushed with the feed gas for 20 s and then exposed to plasma for 60 s."

All chemicals were used as received.",
            "procedure": "The experiments involving different feed gas humidity were performed by using split helium flow (i.e., by mixing dry helium with water-saturated helium in desired proportions). Water-saturated helium was made by bubbling dry helium through a water-filled Drechsel flask at 20 \u00b0C. The relative humidity was determined by weighing the flask before and after the experiment and comparing the data with the available literature values."

However, while the numerical values changed, the observed trends remained persistent. For example, the concentration of DMPO-OH increased with the initial introduction of H\u2082O to He feed gas and decreased with higher H\u2082O content, the concentration of DMPO-OH was lower at 4 mm distance than 10 mm, etc. Thus, the error assessment was performed within a set configuration of the jet for several conditions. Conditions of less uniform plasma nature (i.e., in the presence of large amounts of admixtures in the feed gas) generally lead to an increase in standard deviation of the concentration values. The maximum deviation from the mean was found to be ca. 12%.",
