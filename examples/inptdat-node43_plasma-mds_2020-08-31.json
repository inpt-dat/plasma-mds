The laser beam is specified by the spot diameter of 490 \u00b5m and beam divergence of 1.7 mrad. The parameters of the beam enable to characterize filament structures with diameters down to approx. 100 \u00b5m.</p>\n",

The laser beam is led perpendicular through the effluent region, close to the nozzle of the capillary (z = 0 mm). The output power of the laser is sufficiently low to avert any influence of the beam on the properties of the plasma jet. Deflection of the laser beam due to refraction in the gradient field of the refractive index is recorded at a distance of 80.6 cm from the plasma jet at 10 kHz sample frequency.</p>\n"
